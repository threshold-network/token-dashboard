          Sweeping action is the bridge crossing done every 8 hours. It’s the
          same duration for both directions.

        <BodyMd>
          The sweeping is done every 8 hours in order to preserve a lower bridge
          fee. SPV proofs to confirm Bitcoin transactions are expensive.

        <BodyMd>
          The accumulated deposits and redemptions’ SPV proof costs will be
          split evenly.
