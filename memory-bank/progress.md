### Files Modified

1. **tbtc-v2/typescript/src/lib/ethereum/l1-bitcoin-depositor.ts** - Updated with SUI support
2. **tbtc-v2/typescript/src/lib/ethereum/artifacts/sepolia/SuiBTCDepositorWormhole.json** - Created for SUI support
3. **token-dashboard/src/App.tsx** - Solana wallet provider commented out
4. **token-dashboard/src/hooks/useNonEVMConnection.ts** - Solana code disabled
5. **token-dashboard/src/components/Modal/SelectWalletModal/index.tsx** - Solana wallet option removed

## Execution Summary

The implementation has successfully set up and linked the tbtc-v2 SDK with SUI support to the token-dashboard application. A creative phase was conducted to analyze and address dependency conflicts between Solana packages and SUI integration. The solution involved temporarily disabling Solana-related components to ensure SUI functionality works properly. The application is now running in development mode and is ready for testing the SUI network integration.
