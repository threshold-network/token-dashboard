# Active Context

## Current Task Description

The task was to set up a local development environment for the token-dashboard with a linked tbtc-v2 SDK to test the SUI Network implementation. The setup required configuring both repositories to work with the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and SUI testnet, with proper contract addresses for cross-chain communication via Wormhole. A creative phase was conducted to resolve dependency conflicts between Solana packages and SUI integration.

## Task Classification

- **Level**: 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- **Type**: Setup & Integration
- **Focus**: Cross-Chain Development
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Implementation Completed - Creative Phase Integrated - Ready for User Testing

## Core Requirements

1. ✅ Clone and set up the tbtc-v2 repository locally
2. ✅ Build the tbtc-v2 TypeScript SDK with SUI support
3. ✅ Use yarn link to connect the local SDK to the token-dashboard
4. ✅ Configure the token-dashboard to use testnet environment
5. ✅ Resolve dependency conflicts between Solana and SUI
6. ✅ Start the application for testing

## Implementation Summary

The implementation has been completed successfully. The tbtc-v2 SDK was modified to add support for the SUI network by creating a SuiBTCDepositorWormhole artifact and updating the L1BitcoinDepositor to recognize the SUI chain. The SDK was built and linked to the token-dashboard, which was then started in development mode. A creative phase was conducted to analyze dependency conflicts with Solana packages, resulting in the temporary disabling of Solana-related components.

## Key Components Modified

1. **tbtc-v2/typescript/src/lib/ethereum/l1-bitcoin-depositor.ts** - Updated with SUI support
2. **tbtc-v2/typescript/src/lib/ethereum/artifacts/sepolia/SuiBTCDepositorWormhole.json** - Created for SUI support
3. **token-dashboard/src/App.tsx** - Solana wallet provider commented out
4. **token-dashboard/src/hooks/useNonEVMConnection.ts** - Solana code disabled
5. **token-dashboard/src/components/Modal/SelectWalletModal/index.tsx** - Solana wallet option removed

## Technical Challenges

1. **Node.js Version Compatibility** - The token-dashboard required Node.js v20 for Solana dependencies, while tbtc-v2 SDK was built with Node.js v18. This was solved by using NVM to switch between versions as needed.
2. **SDK Artifact Structure** - Creating the correct structure for the SuiBTCDepositorWormhole artifact required examining existing artifacts and ensuring the new one included all required fields, especially the receipt field needed by the EthersContractDeployment interface.
3. **Wormhole Configuration** - The complex configuration requirements for the Wormhole bridge were addressed by using the deployed contract addresses and chain IDs from the provided information.
4. **Solana Package Conflicts** - Encountered errors with Solana packages (`Attempted import error: 'addCodecSizePrefix' is not exported from '@solana/codecs'`). After evaluating multiple approaches in a creative phase, the solution was to temporarily disable Solana integration to allow SUI functionality to work properly.

## Configuration Details

- **BTCDepositorWormhole proxy on Sepolia**: 0xb306e0683f890BAFa669c158c7Ffa4b754b70C95
- **Implementation Contract Address**: 0x75757a633237D7bb0c51b51952F171BE20C60056
- **ProxyAdmin Address**: 0x8E6C6f8e1551ba79D9ECe97fd584BbE7572cE79f
- **SUI Wormhole Gateway**: 0x1db1fcdaada7c286d77f3347e593e06d8f33b8255e0861033a0a9f321f4eade7
- **Wormhole Chain ID for SUI**: 21
- **Sepolia Chain ID**: 11155111

## Next Steps

The implementation is now complete and ready for user testing. The following steps should be taken:

1. Test SUI wallet connection through the UI
2. Verify the tBTC deposit flow with SUI as the destination
3. Document the actual user experience
