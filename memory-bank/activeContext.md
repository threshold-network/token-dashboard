# Active Context

## Current Task Description

The previous tasks related to SUI Network integration have been completed:
1. Token-dashboard setup with linked tbtc-v2 SDK (TD-SUI-01)
2. BTCDepositorWormhole contract analysis for SUI compatibility (TD-SUI-01.8)

The environment is now fully configured for SUI integration and the contract architecture has been validated. The BTCDepositorWormhole contract was confirmed to be compatible with SUI without modifications when used with the off-chain VAA relayer.

## Task Classification

- **Previous Task**: TD-SUI-01 (SUI Integration Setup)
- **Status**: COMPLETED and ARCHIVED
- **Archive Locations**: 
  - memory-bank/archive/archive-TD-SUI-01-config.md
  - memory-bank/archive/archive-TD-SUI-01-BTCDepositorWormhole.md

## Ready for Next Task

The environment and architecture are now fully prepared for the next phase of development:

1. User testing with actual SUI wallet
2. Implementation of SUI-side WormholeGateway in Move language
3. Integration testing of the complete cross-chain flow
4. Enhancement of the user interface for SUI operations

## Technical Environment

- **tbtc-v2**: Local SDK with SUI support
- **token-dashboard**: Configured for Sepolia testnet
- **SUI Configuration**: Environment variables and artifact structure implemented
- **Solana Integration**: Temporarily disabled to resolve dependency conflicts
- **BTCDepositorWormhole**: Confirmed compatible with SUI integration
- **Off-chain VAA Relayer**: Verified for SUI communication

## Key Contract Addresses

- **BTCDepositorWormhole Proxy**: 0xb306e0683f890BAFa669c158c7Ffa4b754b70C95
- **SUI Wormhole Gateway**: 0x1db1fcdaada7c286d77f3347e593e06d8f33b8255e0861033a0a9f321f4eade7
- **Wormhole Chain ID for SUI**: 21
- **Sepolia Chain ID**: 11155111

## Implementation Structure

The configuration and architecture follow these principles:

1. Artifact-based contract references for both testnet and mainnet
2. Environment-specific configuration approach
3. Clear separation of contract addresses from implementation logic
4. Phased initialization with lazy SUI signer loading
5. Off-chain VAA relayer for efficient cross-chain communication
