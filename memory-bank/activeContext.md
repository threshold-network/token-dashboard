# Active Context

## Current Task Description

The previous task to set up token-dashboard with linked tbtc-v2 SDK for testing the SUI Network integration has been completed and archived. The implementation included configuring both repositories to work with the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and SUI testnet, with proper contract addresses for cross-chain communication via Wormhole. An artifact-based configuration architecture was implemented for the SUI integration.

## Task Classification

- **Previous Task**: TD-SUI-01 (SUI Integration Setup)
- **Status**: COMPLETED and ARCHIVED
- **Archive Location**: memory-bank/archive/archive-TD-SUI-01-config.md

## Ready for Next Task

The environment is now prepared for the next task. The token-dashboard with SUI integration is set up and ready for:

1. User testing with actual SUI wallet
2. Further development of cross-chain functionality
3. Enhancement of the user interface for SUI operations

## Technical Environment

- **tbtc-v2**: Local SDK with SUI support
- **token-dashboard**: Configured for Sepolia testnet
- **SUI Configuration**: Environment variables and artifact structure implemented
- **Solana Integration**: Temporarily disabled to resolve dependency conflicts

## Key Contract Addresses

- **BTCDepositorWormhole Proxy**: 0xb306e0683f890BAFa669c158c7Ffa4b754b70C95
- **SUI Wormhole Gateway**: 0x1db1fcdaada7c286d77f3347e593e06d8f33b8255e0861033a0a9f321f4eade7
- **Wormhole Chain ID for SUI**: 21
- **Sepolia Chain ID**: 11155111

## Implementation Structure

The configuration architecture follows these principles:

1. Artifact-based contract references for both testnet and mainnet
2. Environment-specific configuration approach
3. Clear separation of contract addresses from implementation logic
4. Phased initialization with lazy SUI signer loading
