# Implementation Reflection: Token Dashboard SUI Integration

## Task Summary

The task was to set up a local development environment for the token-dashboard with a linked tbtc-v2 SDK to test the SUI Network implementation. The integration allows Bitcoin deposits via the tBTC protocol with Wormhole bridging to the SUI Network.

## Implementation Accomplishments

### 1. Successfully Set Up tbtc-v2 SDK with SUI Support

- Built the tbtc-v2 TypeScript SDK from source
- Added SUI support by creating a SuiBTCDepositorWormhole artifact
- Updated l1-bitcoin-depositor.ts to include SUI as a destination chain
- Verified that the SDK builds correctly with the changes

### 2. Linked SDK to token-dashboard

- Used yarn link to connect the local SDK to the token-dashboard
- Installed all necessary dependencies with updated Node.js version (v20)
- Started the application successfully in development mode

### 3. Verified Configuration

- Confirmed Sepolia testnet configuration in .env file
- Verified existing SUI wallet provider implementation
- Ensured configuration values (contract addresses, chain IDs) were set correctly

## Technical Details

### SDK Modifications

1. Created an artifact file for the BTCDepositorWormhole contract at:

   ```
   tbtc-v2/typescript/src/lib/ethereum/artifacts/sepolia/SuiBTCDepositorWormhole.json
   ```

2. Updated the artifact loader in l1-bitcoin-depositor.ts to support SUI:

   ```typescript
   case "Sui":
     return SepoliaSuiBTCDepositorWormhole
   ```

3. Verified SUI in DestinationChainName type in contracts/chain.ts

### Node.js Version Management

- tbtc-v2 SDK: Built with Node.js v18
- token-dashboard: Uses Node.js v20 (required for Solana dependencies)
- Used NVM to switch between versions for different repositories

### Configuration Values

- BTCDepositorWormhole Proxy: 0xb306e0683f890BAFa669c158c7Ffa4b754b70C95
- SUI Wormhole Gateway: 0x1db1fcdaada7c286d77f3347e593e06d8f33b8255e0861033a0a9f321f4eade7
- Wormhole Chain ID for SUI: 21
- Sepolia Chain ID: 11155111

## Testing Instructions

To complete the testing phase, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to Sepolia Testnet**

   - Open the running application in your browser
   - Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
   - Ensure the wallet is set to Sepolia testnet

2. **Test SUI Wallet Connection**

   - Install a SUI wallet extension (like Suiet or Sui Wallet)
   - Navigate to the tBTC application section
   - Look for SUI wallet connection option
   - Attempt to connect your SUI wallet

3. **Verify Cross-Chain Deposit Flow**

   - Navigate to the tBTC deposit section
   - Check if SUI is available as a destination chain
   - Fill out the deposit form with SUI as the destination
   - Verify that the UI correctly shows the Wormhole bridge path

4. **Document Results**
   - Note any issues or errors encountered
   - Record successful operations
   - Document any UI feedback related to SUI integration

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Node.js Version Compatibility

- **Challenge**: token-dashboard required Node.js v20, but tbtc-v2 SDK was built with v18
- **Solution**: Used NVM to switch Node versions between repositories

### 2. SDK Artifact Structure

- **Challenge**: Creating the correct structure for the SuiBTCDepositorWormhole artifact
- **Solution**: Examined existing artifacts and ensured the new one included the required receipt field

### 3. Wormhole Configuration

- **Challenge**: Complex configuration requirements for Wormhole bridge
- **Solution**: Referenced deployed contract addresses and chain IDs from provided information

## Next Steps

1. **Complete UI Testing**

   - Verify full deposit flow with SUI destination
   - Test error cases and edge conditions

2. **Documentation Updates**

   - Update project documentation with SUI integration details
   - Create user guide for SUI deposit flow

3. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add more detailed error handling for cross-chain transfers
   - Improve UI feedback during Wormhole bridging process
   - Consider additional tests for the SUI integration

## Conclusion

The implementation has successfully set up the environment needed to test the SUI Network integration. The token-dashboard application is now running with the modified tbtc-v2 SDK, and it should be ready for testing the cross-chain deposit functionality to SUI Network.
