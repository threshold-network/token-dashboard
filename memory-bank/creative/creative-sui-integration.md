# ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: ARCHITECTURE

## Component Description

This creative phase focuses on troubleshooting and enhancing the SUI Network integration in the token-dashboard application. The current implementation includes:

1. A SUIWalletProvider context that manages SUI wallet connections
2. Integration with the tbtc-v2 SDK for cross-chain deposits
3. UI components for SUI wallet selection
4. Non-EVM connection handling

The integration is functional but encountering issues with dependency conflicts, particularly with Solana packages.

## Requirements & Constraints

1. **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Support Bitcoin deposits via Ethereum (Sepolia) to SUI Network using Wormhole
2. **Wallet Integration**: Allow users to connect SUI wallets and interact with SUI contracts
3. **Contract Communication**: Use correct contract addresses and chain IDs for testnet environments
4. **Dependency Management**: Resolve conflicts between Node.js versions and package dependencies
5. **User Experience**: Provide clear UI for cross-chain deposits with proper status updates
6. **Minimal Modifications**: Make targeted changes to fix issues without disrupting the existing architecture

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Resolve Solana Dependency Conflicts

**Approach**: Update package versions to resolve conflicts between Solana packages and SUI dependencies.

**Pros**:

- Maintains all existing functionality including Solana support
- Most comprehensive approach for multi-chain support
- Follows the original design intent of the application

**Cons**:

- More complex to implement and maintain
- Requires careful package version management
- May introduce regressions in either Solana or SUI functionality
- Takes more time to implement and test

### Option 2: Disable Solana Integration

**Approach**: Temporarily disable Solana wallet and integration components to eliminate dependency conflicts.

**Pros**:

- Simpler and faster to implement
- Directly addresses the immediate issue
- Reduces complexity during testing
- Can be reversed once dependency issues are resolved

**Cons**:

- Removes functionality from the application
- May require code changes in multiple places
- Could introduce regressions if not carefully implemented
- Not a permanent solution

### Option 3: Create SUI-Specific Fork

**Approach**: Create a separate branch or fork specifically for SUI integration, removing all Solana dependencies.

**Pros**:

- Complete isolation from Solana-related issues
- Cleaner codebase focused on SUI integration
- Easier to test and maintain for SUI-specific deployments

**Cons**:

- Creates divergent codebases
- More difficult to merge improvements back to main branch
- Duplicates maintenance effort
- Not aligned with the multi-chain vision of the project

### Option 4: Mock Solana Dependencies

**Approach**: Create mock implementations of Solana dependencies that satisfy imports but don't contain actual functionality.

**Pros**:

- Maintains the same import structure
- No need to comment out code
- Can be implemented with minimal changes to existing files
- Easier to revert when proper dependencies are available

**Cons**:

- Could hide actual issues
- May create confusion for developers
- Requires careful implementation to avoid runtime errors
- Doesn't address the root cause of dependency conflicts

## Recommended Approach

**Option 2: Disable Solana Integration** is recommended as the most practical immediate solution.

**Justification**:

1. It directly addresses the dependency conflicts without requiring extensive changes
2. It allows for faster testing of the SUI integration
3. It can be implemented through targeted code modifications with clear comments
4. It provides a path to re-enable Solana functionality in the future
5. It aligns with the current state of the codebase which already has commented-out Solana provider in App.tsx

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Identify Solana-Related Components**:

   - The SolanaWalletProvider in App.tsx (already commented out)
   - Solana wallet connection option in SelectWalletModal/index.tsx
   - Solana-related code in useNonEVMConnection.ts

2. **Required Modifications**:

   - Comment out or remove Solana wallet option from SelectWalletModal
   - Disable Solana-related code in useNonEVMConnection.ts
   - Ensure SUI wallet functionality works independently
   - Add clear comments indicating temporary nature of changes

3. **Dependency Updates**:

   - No dependency changes required for this approach
   - When fixing the SDK, ensure the tbtc-v2 repository doesn't import Solana packages that conflict with the token-dashboard

4. **Testing Strategy**:

   - Verify SUI wallet connection works
   - Confirm cross-chain deposit form shows SUI as an option
   - Test the deposit flow to SUI network
   - Ensure no console errors related to Solana packages

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the disabled Solana functionality
   - Note the dependency conflicts that led to this decision
   - Outline steps to re-enable Solana in the future

## Verification

This approach satisfies all requirements by:

- Maintaining cross-chain functionality for SUI Network
- Enabling SUI wallet integration without dependency conflicts
- Preserving contract communication architecture
- Resolving dependency management issues through targeted disabling
- Providing a clear UI for cross-chain deposits
- Making minimal, well-documented modifications

The recommended approach provides the fastest path to a working SUI integration while laying groundwork for future improvements when dependency issues are resolved.
