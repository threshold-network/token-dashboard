# Threshold Token Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Local development

## Prerequisites

- Make sure your local chain is running (eg. Ganache).
- Clone https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core repo:
  - Make sure the `local` network config in [`/solidity-v1/truffle-config.js`](https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/main/solidity-v1/truffle-config.js#L8-L11) is correct for your chain.
- Clone https://github.com/threshold-network/solidity-contracts repo:
  - Make sure the `development` network config in [`hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/threshold-network/solidity-contracts/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts#L42-L44) is correct for your chain.
- Clone https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa repo:
  - Make sure the `local` network config in [`/solidity/truffle.js`](https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/blob/main/solidity/truffle.js#L30-L35) is correct for your chain.
- Clone https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc repo:
  - Make sure the `development` network config in [`/solidity/truffle-config.js`](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc/blob/main/solidity/truffle-config.js#L54-L58) is correct for your chain.
- Clone https://github.com/keep-network/coverage-pools repo:
  - Make sure the `development` network config in [`/hardhat.config.ts`](https://github.com/keep-network/coverage-pools/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts#L37-L41) is correct for your chain.

## Setup

`yarn`

## Deploy contracts and run dapp

`yarn start:dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**Note:** if you need re run T dapp and all necessary contracts are deployed use `yarn start:dev -m`

# Run T dapp against the Ropsten network

## Update the `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_ID=3
REACT_APP_ETH_HOSTNAME_HTTP=<your http ETH hostname- eg. Infura>
REACT_APP_ETH_HOSTNAME_WS=<your ws ETH hostname- eg. Infura>
// We can skip this env variable- the dapp uses the correct address
// of Multicall contract for Ropsten under the hood.
REACT_APP_MULTICALL_ADDRESS=$MULTICALL_ADDRESS
```

## Setup

`yarn`

## Install Ropsten contracts

```
yarn upgrade @threshold-network/solidity-contracts@ropsten \
  @keep-network/keep-core@ropsten \
  @keep-network/keep-ecdsa@ropsten \
  @keep-network/tbtc@ropsten \
  @keep-network/coverage-pools@ropsten
```

**NOTE:** The `token-dashboard` package contains an indirect dependency to
`@summa-tx/relay-sol@2.0.2` package, which downloads one of its sub-dependencies
via unathenticated `git://` protocol. That protocol is no longer supported by
GitHub. This means that in certain situations installation of the package or
update of its dependencies using Yarn may result in `The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported` error.

As a workaround, we advise changing Git configuration to use `https://` protocol
instead of `git://` by executing:

```
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

## Run T dapp

`yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Production deployment

The following procedure allows to deploy T token dashboard to production:

1. Developer with write access to the repository creates a release branch:
   `releases/mainnet/<version>`. Release branch should never be merged to `main`
   and creating a PR with a release branch is not required.
   Dependencies and project version needs to be updated on the release branch.
   All `-dev`, `-ropsten` dependencies need to be updated to mainnet versions.
   See [this commit](https://github.com/threshold-network/token-dashboard/commit/5452b68886ebc514d941a087973dfa9ac3802a7e)
   for `v1.0.0` release as a good example.
2. Preview of the release branch will be uploaded to `preview.dashboard.threshold.network`
   under the directory named after the release branch. For example:
   `https://preview.dashboard.threshold.network/releases/mainnet/v1.0.0/index.html`.
   A new version will be uploaded after each push to the release branch.
3. After reviewing the mainnet dashboard preview, any developer with write
   access to the repository can tag the commit on the release branch and create
   a new release on GitHub.
4. Once a new release is created, GitHub Action for mainnet T dashboard
   deployment will get automatically invoked. This action requires the manual
   approval of someone else from the development team.
5. Once the release action is approved, the new version is automatically
   deployed to `dashboard.threshold.network`.
